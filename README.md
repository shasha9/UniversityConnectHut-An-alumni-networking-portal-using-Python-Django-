# UniversityConnectHut-An-alumni-networking-portal-using-Python-Django-

## INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on building a platform for an organization where the alumni, present students and faculties can connect with each other. Using this web application the users can see latest announcements on jobs, events of the organization and find nearby alumni. This platform will help to simplify and encourage alumni engagement activities, thereby leveraging the power of alumni relationships. Through these regular interactions colleges are able to keep track of their alumni’s progress, and identify those they can reach out for placements and webinars. An engaged alumni network allows the University to benefit from the skills and experience of the graduates by offering support to the students, to the institution and to each other.


## OBJECTIVES
1.Establishing a strong link between present students, faculties and alumni to improve the overall quality of the institution.

2.Building a knowledge sharing platform in the form of a blog where users can post blogs regarding academics, cultural and placement activities.

3.To make an interactive web application live i.e. hosting on an online server by making it   accessible to any user on any platform.

## METHODOLOGY
In this project, we are going to make an online platform where the students of final and pre-final year and faculties can easily contact the alumni. We will make a web application on which the students can register themselves, can search the opportunities they are looking for, their job profile and the preferred location for the job and internships. 
Alumni of that college can visit their college portal and can contact the students of about the vacancies for the intern as well as for the full-time job. Along with this portal, we are also going to merge a blogging platform more or less similar to Quora, medium etc. on which the faculties or several student clubs can engage with the students and pass the required information regarding the various events. Registered users on this platform can also post blogs related to trending technologies and their fields of interest. Other users can like, comment and share their views.
With the help of front-end (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) and back-end technology (Python Django) we are providing a common interactive platform that can ease the work of placement bodies and career services of a university.
